'''
Delete the middle node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle(i.e any node but first and last node) of a single linked list
given only access to that node.
example:
input: remove c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
output: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f
